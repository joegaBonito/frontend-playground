In this project, I am testing/playing around with front-end techniques.
1. Component1 is about converting images into .svg and manipulating them with CSS/Javascript.
2. Component2 is about implementing and using ngx-filter-pipe, ngx-order-pipe, ngx-pagination for angular.
3. Component3 is about Bootstrap Gallery Template for angular using ngx-gallery. (npm install ngx-gallery --save)
4. Component4 is about the usage of reactivex, Observable and Observer.
5. Component5 is about NgRx which is similar to redux that it helps to keep state throughout the application by allowing data immutable. 'Store' folder is related to this component.
(npm install --save @ngrx/store)
