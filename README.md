In this project, I am testing/playing around with front-end techniques.
1. Component1 is about converting images into .svg and manipulating them with CSS/Javascript.
2. Component2 is about implementing and using ngx-filter-pipe, ngx-order-pipe, ngx-pagination for angular.
3. Component3 is about Bootstrap Gallery Template for angular using ngx-gallery. (npm install ngx-gallery --save)
4. Component4 is about the usage of reactivex, Observable and Observer.
